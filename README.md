# CassandraDemo
Cassandra version: 3.9

This is a project to implement remote cassandra operation.
Some code lines are copied from others, but as for a cassandra beginner, I think it's not a bad thing.
I create this repository to help myself learn cassandra and also I hope this project could also be helpful for cassandra beginners.
